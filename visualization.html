							<p style="text-align: left;">Featured in this page are the different graphs used to visualize the data. After the data have been preprocessed, we can now use tools in order to see the trends of our data.</p>
							<p style="text-align: left;">Here are the graphs tackled in the next sections:</p>

						<h2>Let's view the Histogram.</h2>
						<p>The histogram below shows the yearly distribution of the collected tweets. The y-axis shows the frequency of mis/disinformation tweets while the x-axis shows the year which spans from 2017 to 2022.</p>
					</header>
					<div class="row aln-center">
						<div> <!--class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small"-->

						</div>
					</div>

					<br>
					<p>Here we can see how the frequency of the tweets are generally distributed. Note that 2016 is not included since we were not able to sample 
						misinformation/disinformation tweets about senatoriables during that year. It is not certain whether there are no mis/disinformation tweets
						that year or they are very rare. Additionally, from the histogram we can see that 2022 had the largest number of misinformation and disinformation 
						tweets relating to the senatoriables, comprising of 46 out of 148 (other data were cleared during preprocessing). Other interpretations relating 
						to our hypothesis will be discussed later in the data analysis.

						<h2>Let's view the Heatmap.</h2>
						<p>The heatmap below shows the correlation of the following features: Account type, Following, Followers, Likes, Replies, and Retweets.
							The engagement of the mis/disinformation tweet is given by amount of Likes, Replies, and Retweets.</p>
					</header>
					<div class="row aln-center">
						<div> <!--class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small"-->
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/heatmap.PNG" alt=""/></span>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>In analyzing the heatmap, we can break it down into two groups - the account analysis and the tweet engagement. For the account analysis, we have
						the following features: Account type (categorized), Following, and Followers. There is a negative correlation between the Account type and the number of Following.
						We can infer that the type of account does not affect the number of accounts that it follows, there could be unknown accounts that follow a lot of different accounts.
						As for the Account type and Followers, there is a slight correlation between them. While only a little, this means that there is a pattern seen in some accounts that
						known accounts have more followers. The same can be said for the Following and Followers which also has a slight correlation.
					</p>
					<p>As for the engagement of tweet, the features include: Likes, Replies, and Retweets. In checking the results of the heatmap, it can be seen that each feature has a high correlation with each other.
						This means that the number of likes, replies, and retweets are closely related to each other. The fewer the likes, it is most likely that there are also fewer replies and retweets, and vice versa.
					</p>
					<p>Finally, in comparing the features of the two groups, we can see that there is only just a slight correlation between the analysis of the account and the engagement of a tweet.
						If we look closely on the account type, there is very little correlation with respect to the features of tweet engagement. This means that for most tweets, the account type matters very little to its engagement.

				<div class="container">

						<h2>Let's view the Swarmplot.</h2>
						<p>The swarmplot below shows the comparison between the number of followers of each categorized account type.
							The y-axis shows the number of followers while the x-axis shows the account types categorized as 0 for unknown (Anonymous) and 1 for known (Media, Identified)</p>
					</header>
					<div class="row aln-center">
						<div> <!--class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small"-->
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/swarmplot.PNG" alt=""/></span>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>The diagram demonstrates the distribution of the number of followers based on the account type. We can see that the unknown account types are condensed to having less than 20,000 followers, most of which fall under 0 followers.There is an outlier among the unknown account types which had over 20,000 followers.
						This could be an indication that the anonymous account is famous among its circles to have a huge following despite being unknown.
						As for the known account type, we can clearly see that there is an outlier that had more than 80,000 followers.
						This can be attributed to the account being a famous personality or media.

			<article id="line" class="wrapper style3">
				<div class="container">
					<header>
						<h2>Let's view the Line graph.</h2>
						<p>The line graph below shows the monthly distribution of the collected tweets. Where the y-axis shows the frequency of mis/disinformation tweets while the x-axis shows the months which spanning from January
							2016 to December 2022.</p>
					</header>
					<div class="row aln-center">
						<div> <!--class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small"-->
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/linegraph.png" alt=""/></span>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>The line graph shows a somewhat erratic pattern wherein no months have a constant frequency. We can also see that the most frequent 
						misinformation/disinformation tweets that were sampled were from May 2022. It is possible that this is related to the trend of the data, 
						but it may also be affected by confounding variables such as the Twitter algorithm showing relevant tweets during our sampling. We aim
						to test the current data that we see here with our hypothesis.
