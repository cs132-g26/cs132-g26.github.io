						<h2>Let's talk about our results and findings.</h2>
                        <p>Here is a graph from our analysis:</p>
					</header>                    
					<div class="row">
						<div style="text-align: justify;"> <!--class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small"-->
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/result.png" alt=""/></span>
                            <p>The graph shows the peak dates of mis/disinformation tweets about the redtagging of senatoriables. The highest peaks were found to be during the following months: May 2019, June 2020, November 2020, May 2022, and September 2022. The peak from <strong>May 2019</strong> and <strong>May 2022</strong> coincides with the timing of the 2019 and 2022 senatorial elections.</p>

							<p>Additionally, it is important to note that the months with peaks in mis/disinformation tweets that do not align with senatorial elections were characterized by other significant issues or news topics: In June 2020, the peak might be due to the statement of Senator Risa Hontiveros regarding the guilty verdict on Maria Ressa and Reynaldo Santos Jr., November 2020 saw a peak in mis/disinformation tweets coinciding with a senate hearing on the government's red-tagging practices. September 2022 witnessed a surge in mis/disinformation tweets due to the Makabayan bloc in the House of Representatives criticizing the "blind approval" of the Office of the President's proposed budget for 2023. The controversy surrounding the budget approval process generated heightened online discussions and the dissemination of related mis/disinformation.</p>

                            <p>Due to the non-normal distribution and unequal variance of each group. <strong>Welch's t-test</strong> was performed on the senatorial and non-senatorial groups. The test showed a p-value of <strong>0.0754</strong> which is significant at a 90% confidence interval.</p>
                                    
                            <p>Since the p-value is less than alpha (0.10) we can <strong>reject the null hypothesis</strong> with 90% certainty. Hence, it can be concluded that the timing of senatorial elections has <strong>some influence</strong> on the spread of mis/disinformation about senatorial candidates via the frequency of tweets that contain such mis/disinformation about them. These findings accentuate the potential impact of electoral timing on public discourse and the potential manipulation of information during critical political events.</p>

                            <p>In summary, the study highlights the existence of peaks in mis/disinformation tweets during specific months, particularly those coinciding with senatorial elections. It further emphasizes the statistical significance of the relationship between electoral timing and the spread of such content on social media platforms.</p>

                            <p>These findings shed light on the importance of monitoring and addressing mis/disinformation during critical political periods to safeguard the integrity of public discourse. By understanding these dynamics, better strategies can be developed to counteract the spread of mis/disinformation.</p>

                            <p>The identification of significant peaks in mis/disinformation tweets during specific months, particularly those aligned with senatorial elections, aligns with existing knowledge about the vulnerability of political events to information manipulation. It supports the idea that political campaigns and elections provide a favorable environment for the spread of inaccurate or deceptive content that can shape public views and affect election results.</p>
